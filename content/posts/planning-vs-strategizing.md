learn the difference between strategy and planning AND how to escape the common traps of strategic planning.

starting with a plan is comforting to many of us, but it’s a terrible way to make strategy. His episode, 

planning has been around for a long, long time. 
People would plan out the activities they’re going to engage in. 

More recently, has been a discipline called strategy.

strategy and planning are not the same. So,  just putting them together and calling it strategic planning doesn’t help.
 What most strategic planning is in the world of business has nothing to do with strategy. 
 It’s got the word, but it’s not. It’s a set of activities that the company says it’s going to do.


We’re going to improve customer experience. We’re going to open this new plant. We’re going to start a new talent development program. A whole list of them, and they all sound good, but the results of all of those are not going to make the company happy because they didn’t have a strategy. 


So, what’s a strategy? A strategy is an integrative set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win. So, there’s a theory. Strategy has a theory. 
Here’s why we should be on this playing field, not this other one, and here’s how, on that playing field, we’re going to be better than anybody else at serving the customers on that playing field.  

That theory has to be coherent. It has to be doable. You have to be able to translate that into actions for it to be a great strategy.

 Planning does not have to have any such coherence, and it typically is what people in manufacturing want– the few things they want, to build a new plant, and the marketing people want to launch a new brand, and the talent people want to hire more people– that tends to be a list that has no internal coherence to it and no specification of a way that that is going to accomplish collectively some goal for the company.


See, planning is quite comforting. Plans typically have to do with the resources you’re going to spend. So we’re going to build a plan. We’re going to hire some people. We’re going to launch a new product.  Those are all things that are on the cost side of businesses. Who controls your costs? Who’s the customer of your costs? The answer is, you are. 
You decide how many square feet to lease, how many raw materials to buy, how many people to hire.


Those are more comfortable because you control them. 


A strategy, on the other hand, specifies an outcome, a competitive outcome that you wish to achieve, which involves customers wanting your product or service enough that they will buy enough of it to make the profitability that you’d like to make. The tricky thing about that is that you don’t control them. You might wish you could, but you can’t. They decide, not you. That’s a harder trick. 


So that means putting yourself out and saying, here’s what we believe will happen. We can’t prove it in advance, we can’t guarantee it, but this is what we want to have happen and that we believe will happen. It’s much easier to say, I’ll build a factory, I will hire more people, etcetera, than I will have customers end up liking our offering more than those of competitors.


The tricky thing about planning is that while you’re planning, chances are at least one competitor is figuring out how to win. When US air carriers were busily planning what routes to fly and da-da-da, there was this little company in Texas called Southwest that had a strategy for winning. And at first, that looked largely irrelevant because it was tiny. What Southwest Airlines was aiming for was an outcome.


What they wanted to be is a substitute for Greyhound, a way more convenient way to get around at a price that wasn’t extraordinarily much greater than a Greyhound bus. Southwest said, everybody else is flying hub and spoke. They have hubs, and they fly hub and spoke. We’re going to fly point to point so that we don’t have aircraft waiting on the ground because you only make money when you’re in the air.


We’re going to only fly 737s, one kind of aircraft, so that our gates are set up for those, our systems are set up for those, our training, our simulations are set up. We’re not going to offer meals on the flights because we’re going to specialize in short flights. We’re not going to book through travel agents. We’re going to encourage people to book online because that’s less expensive for everybody and more convenient. 


So, their strategy ended up having a substantially lower cost than any of the major carriers so that they could offer substantially lower prices.
Because it had a way of winning, it got bigger and then bigger and then bigger and then bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until it flies the most passenger seat miles in America. The major carriers were not trying to win against one another. They were all playing to play, as I say. They were playing to participate, maybe buy more planes, get more gates, maybe grow some, not having a theory of here’s how we could be better than our competitors.


And that was fine until somebody came along and said, here’s a way to be better than everybody else for this segment. And so that segment then goes. It’s gone. And the main playing to play players have to share a smaller pie that’s left over after Southwest takes whatever share it wants.


If you’re trying to escape this planning trap, this comfort trap of doing something that’s comfortable but not good for you, how do you start? The most important thing to recognize is that strategy will have angst associated with it. It’ll make you feel somewhat nervous because as a manager, chances are you’ve been taught you should do things that you can prove in advance.


You can’t prove in advance that your strategy will succeed. You can look at a plan and say, well, all of these things are doable. Let’s just do those because they’re within our control. But they won’t add up to much. In strategy, you have to say, if our theory is right about what we can do and how the market will react, this will position us in an excellent way.


Just accept the fact that you can’t be perfect on that, and you can’t know for sure. And that is not being a bad manager. That is being a great leader because you’re giving your organization the chance to do something great. The second thing I do is say, lay out the logic of your strategy clearly. What would have to be true about ourselves, about the industry, about competition, about customers for this strategy to work?


Why do you do that? It’s because you can then watch the world unfold. And if something that you say is in the logic that would have to be true for this to work is not working out quite the way you hoped, it’ll allow you to tweak your strategy. And strategy is a journey, what you want to have as a mechanism for tweaking it, honing it, and refining it so it gets better and better as you go along.


Another thing that helps with strategy is not letting it get overcomplicated. It’s great if you can write your strategy on a single page. Here’s where we’re choosing to play. Here’s how we’re choosing to win. Here are the capabilities we need to have in place.


Here are the management systems. And that’s why it’s going to achieve this goal, this aspiration that we have. Then you lay out the logic, what must be true for that all to work out the way we hope. Go do it, and watch and tweak as you go along.


That may feel somewhat more worry-making, angst-making than planning, but I would tell you that if you plan, that’s a way to guarantee losing. If you do strategy, it gives you the best possible chance of winning.






















## The Perilous Intersection of Strategy and Planning: A Critical Analysis

The world of business is plagued with ambiguity, with the terms 'strategy' and 'planning' often used interchangeably, contributing to a great deal of confusion. In this article, we dive deep into the insightful words of the renowned thinker, Roger Martin, who delineates the difference between strategy and planning. His intriguing take on the matter was first aired in an episode titled "A Plan is Not A Strategy," part of the HBR Quick Study video series in June 2022.

### The Collision of Strategy and Planning

Planning, an age-old concept, involves outlining a sequence of activities or steps to reach a specific goal. Conversely, strategy is a relatively new discipline, often paired with planning to form 'strategic planning.' However, the integration of these two distinct concepts has caused misunderstanding. Martin emphasizes that strategic planning in the business context rarely encapsulates the essence of strategy—it's typically an assortment of initiatives, albeit well-intentioned, that lacks strategic coherence and often doesn't yield satisfactory results.

### Strategy Vs. Planning: The Underlying Difference

A strategy is a cohesive set of choices that uniquely positions a business in a competitive landscape to win. It's a hypothesis, a rationale underlining why a particular playing field is chosen and how a business aims to outshine competitors. A sound strategy must be coherent, achievable, and translatable into actions.

On the other hand, planning doesn't necessarily require such coherence. A plan can be a collection of desirable objectives from different departments within a company, such as manufacturing, marketing, or HR. While these individual goals might seem valuable, they often lack an overarching strategic coherence that ties them together to accomplish a shared goal.

### The Comforting Nature of Planning

Planning is attractive because it is within our control. Plans primarily revolve around the resources we are going to allocate, like hiring people, launching a new product, or leasing a building. As Martin puts it, "You are the customer of your costs," meaning you control these aspects.

Conversely, a strategy requires specifying an outcome—a competitive outcome that involves the uncertain variable of customers' choices. A business doesn't control its customers. The challenge lies in projecting what we believe will happen, not what we can guarantee will occur. Therefore, strategy is inherently riskier and more discomforting.

### The Planning Trap: A Case Study

While planning offers a comforting illusion of control, it can be a trap. The danger becomes apparent when contrasting the traditional U.S. air carriers' approach with that of Southwest Airlines. The traditional carriers were busy planning routes and logistics while Southwest developed a coherent strategy for winning. Southwest aimed to become a more convenient and cost-effective alternative to Greyhound buses. They developed a unique strategy of point-to-point flights, uniformity in aircraft type (737s only), no meals on short flights, and encouraging customers to book online for cost efficiency. Their strategic choices led them to become one of the largest airlines in terms of passenger seat miles.

### Escaping the Planning Trap: Embracing the Strategy Journey

Embracing strategy means accepting the inherent uncertainty and angst that come with it. As a leader, your role is to lay out a coherent strategic logic: what must be true for the strategy to work regarding the business, the industry, competition, and customers. Keeping the strategy clear and simple—one that can fit on a single page—is crucial. Remember, strategy is a journey that involves observing, tweaking, and refining as you go along, based on the unfolding realities.

Accepting the discomfort that accompanies strategy is not indicative of being a bad manager; rather, it signifies the mark of a great leader. Planning, while less anxiety-inducing, merely guarantees participation, not winning. Strategy, on the other hand, provides the best possible chance of victory. As Martin powerfully concludes, "If you plan, that’s a way to guarantee losing. If you do strategy, it gives you the best possible chance of winning."






## The Great Divide Between Strategy and Planning: An Essential Life Skill 

In our personal lives, just as in the business world, the concepts of 'strategy' and 'planning' are frequently intertwined, leading to a wealth of misunderstandings. Renowned thinker, Roger Martin, offers a critical understanding of the differences between these two concepts that apply not only in the business sphere but also to our personal lives and individual projects. This article is based on his insightful ideas from the episode "A Plan is Not A Strategy," as part of the HBR Quick Study video series from June 2022.

### Strategy and Planning: The Meeting Point

Planning is an age-old concept, consisting of outlining a series of steps or activities towards achieving a certain goal. However, strategy, a more recent discipline, is often lumped together with planning, leading to the hybrid concept of 'strategic planning.' This amalgamation has sparked confusion, with many misunderstanding the essence of what strategy truly is.

### The Fundamental Difference

A strategy is an integrative set of choices that uniquely positions you to win in your chosen field of competition, be it a personal project or a professional endeavor. It's essentially a coherent theory as to why you've chosen a particular field and how you intend to excel within it. A robust strategy must be achievable, coherent, and convertible into actionable steps.

On the flip side, planning does not necessarily require such coherence. A plan could be a compilation of unrelated objectives that seem valuable individually but lack an overarching strategic alignment to collectively achieve a common goal.

### The Comfort Zone of Planning

Planning can seem more appealing because it falls within our control. Plans primarily revolve around the resources we allocate towards achieving a goal. It's easy to fall into the comfort trap of planning, where we prioritize actions and decisions that we can control and measure.

In contrast, a strategy necessitates defining a desired outcome—an outcome that might involve variables outside our control. This makes strategy inherently riskier and more discomforting but often more rewarding in the end.

### The Pitfall of the Planning Trap: A Real-World Example

A notable example of the planning trap can be drawn from Southwest Airlines' strategic approach compared to the traditional U.S. air carriers. While the traditional carriers were preoccupied with planning routes and logistics, Southwest was formulating a coherent strategy for success. They aimed to become a more convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional bus travel. Their strategic choices, including point-to-point flights and uniformity in aircraft type, led them to become one of the largest airlines in the U.S.

### Charting a Path Out of the Planning Trap: Embracing the Strategy Journey

To embrace strategy is to accept the inherent discomfort that accompanies it. As you navigate your personal or professional journey, the strategy you develop should involve a clear logic: what needs to be true for your strategy to work concerning your abilities, the circumstances, and potential obstacles. The strategy should be kept clear and simple, ideally fitting on a single page.

Remember, strategy is a journey that requires constant adjustments based on the unfolding realities of life. Embracing the discomfort associated with uncertainty is not a flaw but rather a mark of courage. Planning, while less anxiety-inducing, merely guarantees participation, not winning. Strategy, on the other hand, offers the best possible chance of success. As Martin astutely concludes, "If you plan, that’s a way to guarantee losing. If you do strategy, it gives you the best possible chance of winning."
