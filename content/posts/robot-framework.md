Robot Framework API automation
You can automate Swagger API tests using Robot Framework by following these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries: You'll need to install the `requests` library and the `robotframework-requests` library. You can do this using pip:

```
pip install requests robotframework-requests
```

2. Create a new Robot Framework test suite: Create a new test suite file with the extension `.robot`. For example, `swagger_tests.robot`.

3. Import the necessary libraries: In your test suite file, import the `RequestsLibrary` and `Collections` libraries:

```
*** Settings ***
Library    RequestsLibrary
Library    Collections
```

4. Define variables for the API endpoints: Define variables for the Swagger API endpoints that you want to test. For example:

```
*** Variables ***
${BASE URL}      http://petstore.swagger.io/v2
${GET PETS}      /pet/findByStatus?status=available
${ADD PET}       /pet
```

5. Define test cases: Define test cases for each of the API endpoints. For example:

```
*** Test Cases ***
Get Available Pets
    [Documentation]    Test that retrieves all available pets
    [Tags]    smoke
    Create Session    petstore    ${BASE URL}
    ${response}    Get Request    petstore    ${GET PETS}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status_code}    200
    ${pets}    Set Variable    ${response.json()}
    Should Not Be Empty    ${pets}
```

This test case sends a GET request to the `/pet/findByStatus?status=available` endpoint, verifies that the response status code is 200, and checks that the response contains at least one available pet.

6. Run the test suite: Use the `robot` command to run the test suite:

```
robot swagger_tests.robot
```

This will execute all the test cases defined in the `swagger_tests.robot` file.

Note that you may need to customize the test cases based on the specific Swagger API endpoints that you want to test. You can also use other Robot Framework libraries, such as `String` and `DateTime`, to perform more advanced checks on the API responses.







Robot framework AIO container
Sure, I can help you create a Docker container that can run webUI tests using Robot Framework and Firefox. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Create a Dockerfile: Start by creating a Dockerfile that will define the environment for running your webUI tests. Here's an example Dockerfile that uses Ubuntu as the base image, installs Firefox, and sets up the necessary dependencies for running Robot Framework:

```
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y firefox xvfb python3-pip && \
    pip3 install robotframework robotframework-seleniumlibrary

ENV MOZ_HEADLESS=1
```

2. Build the Docker image: Use the `docker build` command to build the Docker image based on the Dockerfile. For example, if your Dockerfile is named `Dockerfile` and is in the current directory, you can run the following command:

```
docker build -t robot-framework-firefox .
```

This will build a Docker image with the tag `robot-framework-firefox`.

3. Run the Docker container: Once you have built the Docker image, you can use the `docker run` command to start a Docker container and run your Robot Framework tests. Here's an example command that runs a sample test case:

```
docker run --rm -v /path/to/tests:/tests robot-framework-firefox robot -d /tests/results /tests/sample_test_case.robot
```

This command mounts the directory containing your test cases (`/path/to/tests`) as a volume inside the Docker container, so that the tests can access them. It also specifies the output directory for the test results (`/tests/results`) and the name of the sample test case (`sample_test_case.robot`).

Note that you may need to customize the command based on the specific needs of your tests.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to create a Docker container that can run webUI tests using Robot Framework and Firefox. If you need further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask!
