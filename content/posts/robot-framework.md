Robot Framework API automation
You can automate Swagger API tests using Robot Framework by following these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries: You'll need to install the `requests` library and the `robotframework-requests` library. You can do this using pip:

```
pip install requests robotframework-requests
```

2. Create a new Robot Framework test suite: Create a new test suite file with the extension `.robot`. For example, `swagger_tests.robot`.

3. Import the necessary libraries: In your test suite file, import the `RequestsLibrary` and `Collections` libraries:

```
*** Settings ***
Library    RequestsLibrary
Library    Collections
```

4. Define variables for the API endpoints: Define variables for the Swagger API endpoints that you want to test. For example:

```
*** Variables ***
${BASE URL}      http://petstore.swagger.io/v2
${GET PETS}      /pet/findByStatus?status=available
${ADD PET}       /pet
```

5. Define test cases: Define test cases for each of the API endpoints. For example:

```
*** Test Cases ***
Get Available Pets
    [Documentation]    Test that retrieves all available pets
    [Tags]    smoke
    Create Session    petstore    ${BASE URL}
    ${response}    Get Request    petstore    ${GET PETS}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status_code}    200
    ${pets}    Set Variable    ${response.json()}
    Should Not Be Empty    ${pets}
```

This test case sends a GET request to the `/pet/findByStatus?status=available` endpoint, verifies that the response status code is 200, and checks that the response contains at least one available pet.

6. Run the test suite: Use the `robot` command to run the test suite:

```
robot swagger_tests.robot
```

This will execute all the test cases defined in the `swagger_tests.robot` file.

Note that you may need to customize the test cases based on the specific Swagger API endpoints that you want to test. You can also use other Robot Framework libraries, such as `String` and `DateTime`, to perform more advanced checks on the API responses.







Robot framework AIO container
Sure, I can help you create a Docker container that can run webUI tests using Robot Framework and Firefox. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Create a Dockerfile: Start by creating a Dockerfile that will define the environment for running your webUI tests. Here's an example Dockerfile that uses Ubuntu as the base image, installs Firefox, and sets up the necessary dependencies for running Robot Framework:

```
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y firefox xvfb python3-pip && \
    pip3 install robotframework robotframework-seleniumlibrary

ENV MOZ_HEADLESS=1
```

2. Build the Docker image: Use the `docker build` command to build the Docker image based on the Dockerfile. For example, if your Dockerfile is named `Dockerfile` and is in the current directory, you can run the following command:

```
docker build -t robot-framework-firefox .
```

This will build a Docker image with the tag `robot-framework-firefox`.

3. Run the Docker container: Once you have built the Docker image, you can use the `docker run` command to start a Docker container and run your Robot Framework tests. Here's an example command that runs a sample test case:

```
docker run --rm -v /path/to/tests:/tests robot-framework-firefox robot -d /tests/results /tests/sample_test_case.robot
```

This command mounts the directory containing your test cases (`/path/to/tests`) as a volume inside the Docker container, so that the tests can access them. It also specifies the output directory for the test results (`/tests/results`) and the name of the sample test case (`sample_test_case.robot`).

Note that you may need to customize the command based on the specific needs of your tests.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to create a Docker container that can run webUI tests using Robot Framework and Firefox. If you need further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask!

```

**Step 4: Install SeleniumLibrary**
SeleniumLibrary is a web testing library for Robot Framework. Install it via pip:

```bash
pip3 install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
```

**Step 5: Install WebDriver**
WebDriver is needed for browser-based testing. For example, if you plan to automate Chrome browser, you would need ChromeDriver. Download and install it:

```bash
wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/{version}/chromedriver_linux64.zip
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver
```

**Remember to replace `{version}` with the version compatible with the installed Chrome browser on your machine.**

**Step 6: Install Robot Framework IDE (RIDE) - Optional**
RIDE is a development environment for Robot Framework. It provides a simple interface for writing and managing test cases. You can skip this step if you prefer using another IDE or text editor:

```bash
pip3 install robotframework-ride
```

To run RIDE, simply type `ride.py` in the Terminal.

With this setup, you now have the necessary components to begin creating automated tests with the Robot Framework on Ubuntu. It's advisable to explore the Robot Framework's extensive User Guide for more information and examples to get started with your first test cases.







Sure, here's a simple test case using Robot Framework's keyword-driven syntax. This test will open Google, input a search term, and verify if the search results page is displayed.

To implement this, we will use the SeleniumLibrary to interact with the web browser.

```robot
*** Settings ***
Library  SeleniumLibrary

*** Variables ***
${URL}  https://www.google.com
${BROWSER}  chrome
${SEARCH_BOX}  name:q
${SEARCH_BUTTON}  name:btnK
${SEARCH_TERM}  OpenAI

*** Test Cases ***
Google Search Test
    Open Browser To Google Page
    Input Search Term
    Submit Search
    [Teardown]  Close Browser

*** Keywords ***
Open Browser To Google Page
    Open Browser  ${URL}  ${BROWSER}
    Wait Until Page Contains Element  ${SEARCH_BOX}

Input Search Term
    Input Text  ${SEARCH_BOX}  ${SEARCH_TERM}
    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds  2x  1s  Page Should Contain Element  ${SEARCH_BUTTON}

Submit Search
    Press Key  ${SEARCH_BOX}  \\13
    Wait Until Page Contains  ${SEARCH_TERM}
```

In this test script:

- `*** Settings ***` is where you import the necessary libraries.
- `*** Variables ***` is where you declare the variables.
- `*** Test Cases ***` is where you list your test cases.
- `*** Keywords ***` is where you define custom keywords.

The `Google Search Test` case will:

1. Open the Google homepage.
2. Wait until the search box is present.
3. Enter the search term (in this case, "OpenAI") into the search box.
4. Press the "Enter" key (`\\13` is the ASCII code for "Enter").
5. Wait until the search results page contains the search term.
6. Close the browser once the test is finished.

Please replace `${BROWSER}` and `${SEARCH_TERM}` with your preferred browser and search term respectively. The browser you use must match with the WebDriver you've installed as explained in the previous setup instructions.





Integrating Robot Framework into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines involves multiple steps. Let's use Jenkins as an example for a CI server, as it's one of the most commonly used tools. 

**Step 1: Install necessary plugins**

First, ensure that you've installed the necessary plugins on Jenkins. You will need the following:
- Robot Framework plugin: This will allow Jenkins to display the test results in a much more visual and readable format.
- Any required plugins for your version control system (for example, the Git plugin if you're using Git).

**Step 2: Configure a Jenkins Job**

Next, create a new Jenkins job and configure it to fetch the code from your version control system. 

1. Click on "New Item" from the Jenkins dashboard.
2. Name your job, choose "Freestyle project", and click "OK".
3. In the Source Code Management section, select your version control system (like Git) and provide the repository URL.

**Step 3: Configure Build**

Under the Build section, you need to configure the execution of your Robot Framework tests.

1. Click on "Add build step" and select "Execute shell" or "Execute Windows batch command" based on your OS.
2. In the command input field that appears, provide the command that triggers your Robot Framework tests, something like: `robot -d results tests/` 
   - This command runs the Robot Framework tests located in the 'tests/' directory and outputs the results into the 'results/' directory.

**Step 4: Configure Post-build Actions**

Under the Post-build Actions section, you can instruct Jenkins to process and display your Robot Framework test results.

1. Click on "Add post-build action" and select "Publish Robot Framework test results".
2. In the "Robot results" field, specify the location of your output files, like `results/output.xml`.

**Step 5: Save and Execute the Job**

After setting up the job, you can manually trigger it by clicking on "Build Now". Jenkins will fetch the latest code from your repository, execute the tests using Robot Framework, and display the results. 

To fully realize the benefits of CI/CD, you should configure the job to run automatically whenever there are changes to the codebase (using webhooks or polling) or at regular intervals (using scheduled builds).

By integrating Robot Framework into your CI/CD pipelines, you can ensure that your tests are run automatically whenever the code changes, and any issues are detected early in the development cycle.





Sure, I'll walk you through the steps of setting up Jenkins and creating an end-to-end (E2E) demo of a Robot Framework test case.

**Part 1: Jenkins Installation**

*Step 1:* First, you need to install Jenkins on your system. If you're using Ubuntu, open Terminal and type:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

*Step 6:* Click "Save".

*Step 7:* Click "Build Now" to manually trigger the job.

Remember to replace the "tests/" directory in the robot command with the actual path to your Robot Framework test files in your repository.

After executing the job, Jenkins will fetch the latest code from your Git repository, run the Robot Framework tests, and display the results in a user-friendly format, courtesy of the Robot Framework plugin. This setup gives you a simple E2E demo of a Robot Framework test case running from Jenkins.





I see, let's break it down into a more detailed step-by-step process. We will use a local directory instead of a Git repository. 

**Part 1: Install Jenkins**

1. **Update your system:** First, make sure your system is up-to-date by running `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` in Terminal.

2. **Install Java:** Jenkins requires Java to run. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) using the command: `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`.

3. **Add the Jenkins Debian repository:** Add the Jenkins key and source list using the following commands:

```bash
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
```

4. **Install Jenkins:** Update your local package index and then install Jenkins by running `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt install jenkins`.

5. **Start Jenkins:** Now, start the Jenkins service using `sudo systemctl start jenkins`.

6. **Enable Jenkins to start at system boot:** You can make Jenkins start up whenever your system boots by using `sudo systemctl enable jenkins`.

**Part 2: Setup Jenkins**

1. **Initial setup:** In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080. You will see a setup wizard.

2. **Unlock Jenkins:** Retrieve the auto-generated administrative password using `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`. Copy and paste this password into the Jenkins setup wizard and click "Continue".

3. **Customize Jenkins:** Select "Install suggested plugins" to install the recommended set of plugins, which are based on most common use cases.

4. **Create an Admin User:** You'll be prompted to create your first admin user. Enter the desired username, password, full name, and email, then click "Save and Continue".

5. **Instance Configuration:** Confirm the preferred URL for Jenkins, then click "Save and Finish".

6. **Setup Complete:** Click "Start using Jenkins" to complete the setup.

**Part 3: Install Robot Framework Plugin**

1. **Manage Plugins:** Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Available". 

2. **Search for Robot Framework plugin:** Use the filter bar to find "Robot Framework plugin", select it, and click "Install without restart".

**Part 4: Configure Jenkins Job**

1. **Create a new job:** Click "New Item" from the Jenkins dashboard.

2. **Job details:** Enter a name for the job, select "Freestyle project", and click "OK".

3. **Source Code Management:** As we are using a local directory, you can leave this section empty.

4. **Build Triggers:** If you want the tests to run periodically, you can set it up here using "Build periodically" and specifying the schedule in cron format.

5. **Build Environment:** Configure the environment necessary for your tests.

6. **Build:** In the Build section, select "Add build step" > "Execute shell". Enter the command to run your Robot Framework tests. Assuming you've navigated to the directory containing the tests, it would look something like this: `robot -d results tests/`.

7. **Post-build Actions:** In the Post-build Actions section, select "Add post-build action" > "Publish Robot Framework test results". In the "Robot results" field, specify the location of the results (e.g., `results/output.xml`).

8. **Save and run:** Click "Save". Now, to run your job, click "Build Now" on the job page.

Remember, the `robot -d results tests/` command assumes your test files are in a directory named 'tests/' in your Jenkins workspace and that the results will be stored in a directory named 'results/'. Adjust these paths as necessary based on your actual directory structure.

With this setup, you now have a Jenkins job configured to run your local Robot Framework tests. Jenkins will execute the tests whenever the job is triggered and display the results in a user-friendly manner thanks to the Robot Framework plugin.






Yes, in order to run Robot Framework tests, the machine where Jenkins server runs (be it your local machine or a remote server) needs to have both Python and Robot Framework installed. Here's a step-by-step guide to install them:

**Step 1: Install Python**

If you don't already have Python installed, you can do so by running the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

You can confirm the installation by checking the version of Python and pip:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

**Step 2: Install Robot Framework**

Once Python and pip are installed, you can install Robot Framework using pip:

```bash
pip3 install robotframework
```

You can confirm the installation of Robot Framework by checking its version:

```bash
robot --version
```

**Step 3: Install SeleniumLibrary**

In order to interact with web browsers, you'll also need to install SeleniumLibrary:

```bash
pip3 install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
```

**Step 4: Install WebDriver**

Lastly, install the appropriate WebDriver for the browser you want to use for testing. If you're using Chrome, you would need to install ChromeDriver. Here is how you can install it:

```bash
wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.41/chromedriver_linux64.zip
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver
```

Please note that the above command will download a specific version of ChromeDriver. You should replace the URL with the download link for the latest version that matches your installed version of Chrome. You can find this link on the [ChromeDriver download page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

Once you've completed these steps, your Jenkins server should be able to execute Robot Framework tests.
