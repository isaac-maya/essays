## What I believed leadership was
As a kid, I used to equate leadership with authority. The notion that leaders were in charge was commonplace in my mind. I thought leadership was all about the whistle around your neck; it was all about giving orders.

Of course, humans breed leader individuals everywhere, from my grandma to young kids in kindergarten. But at that moment, for me, it was easier to identify such figures in soccer coaches.

Most coaches seemed to have a secret recipe, an understanding that went beyond the player's grasp. See how I started the last sentence with the word most? This is key to a eureka moment that was beginning to slow cook
## Eureka
Playing in different teams, some winning, some losing, I noticed how not all mentors were met with the same degree of acceptance. Despite their superior knowledge, I occasionally found the group dismissive of their advice. 

That made me wonder, "What separates the leader who can inspire me to play my heart out from the one who just makes me want to sit on the sidelines?"

Through this introspection, I discovered that following someone I desired to emulate was easier. For example, it was simpler to strive for a coach who led a respectful, fit life with a loving family compared to one perceived as an unhealthy, inebriated individual.

I began to recognize the influence of a truly believed philosophy on both the game's outcome and my life.

## What leadership is
A leader's life is a reflection of their leadership. True leaders embody the characteristics we admire, whether physical fitness, engaging hobbies, or a contented life. Our minds are drawn to follow them as we subconsciously understand that if we emulate their actions, we may attain similar successes.

Leadership isn't just about holding the whistle; it's about living a life that inspires others to step up their game. Because that's the real goal, slowly turn ordinary into extraordinary.
