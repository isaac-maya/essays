sed, or Stream Editor, is a powerful utility in Unix/Linux. While it might seem complex at first, sed provides a powerful, flexible method for managing and manipulating text.

## 1. Basic command structure
The `sed` command is a powerful command-line tool used for text manipulation. The basic structure of a `sed` command is as follows:

```bash
sed 'options... s/search/replace/flags' filename
```

- `options`: These are optional parameters for the `sed` command like `-n` or `-e`.
- `s`: This is the substitute command, telling `sed` to replace text.
- `search`: This is the text that `sed` will look for in the file.
- `replace`: This is the text that `sed` will replace the `search` text with.
- `flags`: These are optional parameters that can modify the behavior of the substitution command, such as `g` for global replacement.
- `filename`: The name of the file `sed` will read from.

## 2. Substitution in sed
One of the most common uses of sed is to replace one bit of text with another.

### Substitute first occurrence

```bash
echo "Hello World" | sed 's/World/Universe/'
```

This command will replace the first occurrence of the word "World" with "Universe". The output will be "Hello Universe".

### Substitute all occurrences of text

```bash
echo "Hello World World" | sed 's/World/Universe/g'
```
By adding the `g` flag (which stands for global), this command will replace all occurrences of the word "World" with "Universe". The output will be "Hello Universe Universe".

### Substitute only on lines matching a pattern

```bash
echo -e "Hello World\nHello Universe" | sed '/Universe/s/Hello/Goodbye/'
```

This command will replace "Hello" with "Goodbye", but only on lines that contain "Universe". The output will be:

```
Hello World
Goodbye Universe
```

### Ignoring case during substitution

```bash
echo "Hello World" | sed 's/world/Universe/I'
```

This command will replace "World" with "Universe", regardless of case. The `I` flag makes the substitution case-insensitive. The output will be "Hello Universe".

### Substitute in place and create a backup

```bash
sed -i.bak 's/search/replace/g' filename
```

This command will replace all occurrences of "search" with "replace" in the file and save the original file as `filename.bak`.

### Suppress automatic printing with `-n` and print only if substitution occurs

```bash
sed -n 's/search/replace/p' filename
```

This command will replace "search" with "replace" and only print lines where the substitution has occurred.


## 3. Deleting Lines with sed
sed can also delete lines in a text file that match a certain pattern.

### Delete the 3rd line of a file

```bash
sed '3d' filename
```

This command will delete the 3rd line of the file.

### Delete the last line of a file

```bash
sed '$d' filename
```

This command will delete the last line of the file.

### Delete a range of lines

```bash
sed '2,5d' filename
```

This command will delete lines 2 to 5 of the file.

### Delete lines matching a pattern

```bash
sed '/pattern_to_delete/d' filename
```

This command will delete all lines containing "pattern_to_delete".

### Delete all lines not matching a pattern

```bash
sed '/pattern_to_keep/!d' filename
```

This command will delete all lines that do not contain "pattern_to_keep".

### Delete lines from a pattern to the end of file

```bash
sed '/pattern_to_start/, $d' filename
```

This command will delete all lines starting from the first occurrence of "pattern_to_start" to the end of the file.

### Delete lines from the start of the file to a pattern

```bash
sed '1,/pattern_to_stop/d' filename
```

This command will delete all lines from the start of the file to the first occurrence of "pattern_to_stop".


## 4. Inserting and Appending Text
You can use sed to insert or append text before or after a matched line.

### Insert text before a line

```bash
sed '3i\This is the inserted line.' filename
```

This command will insert the line "This is the inserted line." before the third line of the file.

### Append text after a line

```bash
sed '3a\This is the appended line.' filename
```

This command will append the line "This is the appended line." after the third line of the file.

### Insert text before every line that matches a pattern

```bash
sed '/pattern_to_match/i\This is the inserted line.' filename
```

This command will insert "This is the inserted line." before every line that contains "pattern_to_match".

### Append text after every line that matches a pattern

```bash
sed '/pattern_to_match/a\This is the appended line.' filename
```

This command will append "This is the appended line." after every line that contains "pattern_to_match".

Also, note the use of the `\` character after the `i` and `a` commands. This is to indicate that what follows should be treated as the text to insert or append, not as more commands or flags.


## 5. Multi-Line Operations
sed is not limited to single line operations. Working with multiple lines in `sed` is made possible by using commands like `N`, `D`, `P`, `n`, and `d`.

### Print the line after matching a pattern

```bash
echo -e "Hello\nWorld" | sed -n '/Hello/{n;p;}'
```

In this example, `sed` will only print the line after "Hello". The `-n` option suppresses automatic printing, and the `n` command fetches the next line into the pattern space.

### Delete the line after matching a pattern

```bash
echo -e "Hello\nWorld" | sed '/Hello/{n;d;}'
```

In this example, `sed` will delete the line after "Hello".

### Print the line before matching a pattern

```bash
echo -e "Hello\nWorld" | sed -n '/World/{x;p;d;}; x'
```

In this example, `sed` will only print the line before "World". The `x` command exchanges the pattern space and the hold space, essentially allowing us to remember the previous line.

### Replace a string over multiple lines

```bash
echo -e "Hello\nWorld" | sed '/Hello/,/World/s/Hello/Hi/'
```

This command will replace "Hello" with "Hi" in the range from lines containing "Hello" to lines containing "World".

### Append the next line to the pattern space and perform operation

```bash
echo -e "Hello\nWorld" | sed '/Hello/{N;s/\n/ /;}'
```

This command uses the `N` command to append the next line to the pattern space and then replaces the newline character with a space, effectively joining the two lines together.

### Delete consecutive lines with the same text

```bash
echo -e "Hello\nHello" | sed '$!N; /^\(.*\)\n\1$/!P; D'
```

This command compares each line with the next, and if they are identical, it deletes one of them.

Remember that the `N`, `D`, and `P` commands work on the pattern space in `sed`, which is the area where `sed` holds the lines it is currently working on. The `N` command appends the next line to the pattern space, the `D` command deletes the earliest appended line, and the `P` command prints out the earliest appended line.


**Note:** All of these commands will print the result to the standard output. The original file will not be changed.


## 6. In-place Editing

If you want to edit the file in-place, you can add the `-i` option.

### Replace 'old' with 'new' in a file

```bash
sed -i 's/old/new/g' filename
```

This command replaces every occurrence of 'old' with 'new' in the file. The changes are made directly in the file.

### Delete lines matching a pattern in a file

```bash
sed -i '/pattern_to_delete/d' filename
```

This command deletes all lines containing 'pattern_to_delete' directly in the file.

### Insert a line before the 3rd line

```bash
sed -i '3i\This is the inserted line.' filename
```

This command inserts 'This is the inserted line.' before the 3rd line of the file.

### Append a line after the 3rd line

```bash
sed -i '3a\This is the appended line.' filename
```

This command appends 'This is the appended line.' after the 3rd line of the file.
