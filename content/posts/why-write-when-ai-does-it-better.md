# The Age of the Essay and AI: A Blend of Old and New

In September 2004, Paul Graham wrote an influential essay called "The Age of the Essay," in which he explored the evolution of essay writing and argued that the true purpose of an essay was to figure out what one thinks about a subject, not to present pre-formed ideas. Today, nearly two decades later, a new question looms over the realm of writing: "Why write when AI can do it better?"

The rise of AI, or artificial intelligence, in writing has been startling. Machine learning models like GPT-3 from OpenAI can now generate remarkably human-like text, prompting many to wonder if human writers will soon be obsolete. But the introduction of AI into the equation brings a whole new dimension to Graham's arguments about the purpose and process of writing essays.

AI is capable of producing text that is grammatically correct and structurally sound, often indistinguishable from human-produced content at first glance. It can mimic styles, recycle ideas, and combine them in new ways. But can AI truly replicate the human process of forming and expressing original thoughts, as Graham suggests is the purpose of the essay?

For Graham, an essay was a journey of exploration, starting from a place of uncertainty and aiming for understanding. The essayist doesn't necessarily know where they are going when they start, but they follow the trail of their thoughts, allowing their mind to connect, diverge, and delve into the depth of an idea. This mental exercise of grappling with concepts, refining ideas, and coming up with new insights, all shaped by one's unique experiences, perspective, and style, creates the essence of an essay.

AI, however accomplished, does not possess personal experiences or an organic cognitive process. It learns from vast amounts of data fed into it, identifying patterns and mimicking them in its output. It lacks the subjective consciousness and personal perspective inherent to human existence. Thus, while it can simulate the 'product' of human thought, it cannot replicate the 'process' of human thought.

Therefore, the question, "Why write when AI can do it better?" seems to misunderstand both the nature of essay writing, as explained by Graham, and the abilities of AI. AI can mimic the form of an essay, but it does not and cannot engage in the thinking process that makes an essay truly valuable and unique. It cannot ponder, speculate, or engage in self-doubt; it can't stumble upon an unexpected revelation or experience a sudden change of heart. AI can't have a favorite word, a pet peeve, or a sudden spark of inspiration while walking in the park.

In conclusion, AI undoubtedly brings new possibilities to the realm of writing and will continue to be a valuable tool for many practical applications. However, it is not a replacement for human essayists. The essay, in its truest form as Graham envisioned it, is a product of human thought, experience, and emotion. Even in the age of AI, there remains not only room, but also a profound need for human voices, human experiences, and human essays. Because at its core, writing is less about the final product and more about the journey of discovery â€“ a journey AI is yet to embark upon.
