## Quality Over Quantity

Nowadays everyone expects things to work right out of the box. Companies that create software are no different. QA ensures that no pesky bugs or glitches mess up the software's performance.

While it is logical to assume that more tests would mean a more quality, the reality is more complex. For instance, consider a QA process where the primary metric is the number of test cases executed. The team, driven to maximize this number, might rush through tests to rack up their count.A high number of test cases might look impressive on reports, but if these tests fail to effectively evaluate the software for potential issues, their value diminishes. Heavy reliance on numerical metrics can often mask the true state of software quality.

The advantages of moving away from a dated quantitative approach that emphasizes the number of test cases, defect count, etc... to a quality-oriented approach focusing on the effectiveness and efficiency of testing; result in a more nuanced and complete understanding of the software's reliability.

## Saving Money with QA

Now, you might be wondering: Why does it matter to a company's bottom line? Imagine releasing a software full of glitches. Developers need to drop everything to figure out the problem, create a solution (or a "hotfix"), test it, and finally distribute it to users. Sounds time-consuming, right? That's because it is, and it costs a lot of money too.

Then there's the extra pressure on customer support teams. They have to handle calls from frustrated users and spend time walking them through the fixes. This increases customer support costs even more.

## Protecting a Company's Reputation

Money aside, there's something even more important at stake: a company's reputation. We've all been there: you buy something, it doesn't work, and you feel annoyed. Repeated experiences like this cause customers to lose faith in a company, and before long, they might start looking for alternatives.

And in today's world, word spreads fast. People love to share their experiences—good and bad—online. So, one bad software release could lead to a flood of negative reviews. QA metrics should tell us how good we are at catching potential issues before the software reaches users.

## Measuring the Right Things

As we’ve seen, it's not enough to count the number of tests or the number of bugs found. We need to measure things that give us a better understanding of the software's quality.

Some useful measures include:

- **Test coverage**: What proportion of the software is being tested?
- **Defect density**: How many bugs are there in a certain amount of code?
- **Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE)**: How effective is the testing in finding and fixing bugs?
- **Escaped defects**: How many bugs made it to the final version of the software?
- **User-reported bugs**: How many issues are users facing?
- **Customer satisfaction scores**: Are users happy with the software?

## Making QA Part of the Culture

QA is a mindset. By prioritizing quality over sheer numbers, companies can create software that works well and satisfies users. And when customers are happy, they're more likely to stick around and spread the word. In the end, QA is not just about avoiding costs; it's about creating value.
