# Why Bother Writing When AI Can Do It For You?

ai can write lots of things, from code to jokes or even novels. I can help you write that short film youve haved in mind for years, yet havent wrote a paragraph of it. It can help you redact emails in a way that make you sound as professional adn capable as those Nigerian princes asking for help.

come on, it even can help yu write this essay. You just have to ask the right questions.

automation has improved the quality of many products and processes we use everyday. Why would a written product improve with AI then?



The rise of AI, or artificial intelligence, in writing has been startling. Machine learning models like GPT-3 from OpenAI can now generate remarkably human-like text, prompting many to wonder if human writers will soon be obsolete. But the introduction of AI into the equation brings a whole new dimension to Graham's arguments about the purpose and process of writing essays.

AI is capable of producing text that is grammatically correct and structurally sound, often indistinguishable from human-produced content at first glance. It can mimic styles, recycle ideas, and combine them in new ways. But can AI truly replicate the human process of forming and expressing original thoughts, as Graham suggests is the purpose of the essay?




well this is a question most of us already know the answer. AI will improve writing in many situations. I will be improved by the quantity, so instead of posting 1 article each month AI can help you post 1 article a day. And depending on eachs own ability with the letter it can even improve your style and writing. Clearly AI in the field on written mediums is already changing whats possible.

we go back to the initial question, Wht bother writing when ai can do it for you? Almost 20 years ago, Paul graham already answered this question with his influental post "the age of the essayy."

through this essay he explored and argued the true purpose of an essay which is to figue out what one thinks about a subject.

For Graham, an essay was a journey of exploration, starting from a place of uncertainty and aiming for understanding. The essayist doesn't necessarily know where they are going when they start, but they follow the trail of their thoughts, allowing their mind to connect, diverge, and delve into the depth of an idea. This mental exercise of grappling with concepts, refining ideas, and coming up with new insights, all shaped by one's unique experiences, perspective, and style, creates the essence of an essay.

AI, however accomplished, does not possess personal experiences or an organic cognitive process. It learns from vast amounts of data fed into it, identifying patterns and mimicking them in its output. It lacks the subjective consciousness and personal perspective inherent to human existence. Thus, while it can simulate the 'product' of human thought, it cannot replicate the 'process' of human thought.

Therefore, the question, "Why write when AI can do it better?" seems to misunderstand both the nature of essay writing, as explained by Graham, and the abilities of AI. AI can mimic the form of an essay, but it does not and cannot engage in the thinking process that makes an essay truly valuable and unique. It cannot ponder, speculate, or engage in self-doubt; it can't stumble upon an unexpected revelation or experience a sudden change of heart. AI can't have a favorite word, a pet peeve, or a sudden spark of inspiration while walking in the park.

In conclusion, AI undoubtedly brings new possibilities to the realm of writing and will continue to be a valuable tool for many practical applications. However, it is not a replacement for human essayists. The essay, in its truest form as Graham envisioned it, is a product of human thought, experience, and emotion. Even in the age of AI, there remains not only room, but also a profound need for human voices, human experiences, and human essays. Because at its core, writing is less about the final product and more about the journey of discovery â€“ a journey AI is yet to embark upon.
